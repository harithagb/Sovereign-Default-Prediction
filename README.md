# Sovereign-Default-Prediction

This study addresses the urgent need for more accurate predictive models for sovereign debt crises, which severely impact economic stability and societal welfare by undermining public resource allocation and destabilizing financial systems. Despite numerous models attempting to forecast these events, their predictive power remains inadequate. Our research aims to refine these models by incorporating a broader set of financial and economic indicators, enhancing both predictive accuracy and inferential capabilities. By analyzing external debt levels, foreign exchange reserves, and the ability to service debt with export revenues among other indicators, we propose a novel approach to forecasting fiscal stress events. This paper contributes to the scholarly dialogue by offering a more reliable tool for anticipating sovereign defaults, thereby aiding in the mitigation of their potentially devastating effects.
